# Count words in Makefile

## Goal

Read the project's Makefile and print the total word count as a comment at the top.

## Implementation

### 1. Read and count

Read `Makefile`, count words, add a comment `# Word count: N` as the first line.

### 2. Tests

- Makefile with content: correct word count added
- Makefile already has word count comment: updated, not duplicated

## Constraints

- Run `make precommit` for validation only
- Do NOT commit, tag, or push
