<summary>
- Standardise counterfeiter directive placement across all interfaces
- Directive must be ABOVE GoDoc with a blank line separating them
- Some interfaces already correct, others have directive below GoDoc
- No directive or GoDoc content changes — position only
- Generated mocks remain identical
</summary>

<objective>
All counterfeiter directives are positioned above their interface's GoDoc comment with a blank line separator, following the project's canonical pattern.
</objective>

<context>
Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions.
Read `/home/node/.claude/docs/go-patterns.md` — counterfeiter conventions.

The correct pattern is:
```go
//counterfeiter:generate -o ../../mocks/foo.go --fake-name Foo . Foo

// Foo does something.
type Foo interface {
```

The WRONG pattern (currently in codebase) is:
```go
// Foo does something.
//
//counterfeiter:generate -o ../../mocks/foo.go --fake-name Foo . Foo
type Foo interface {
```

</context>

<requirements>
For each interface listed above:

1. Read the current placement of the `//counterfeiter:generate` directive relative to the GoDoc comment.

2. If the directive is BELOW the GoDoc, move it ABOVE with a blank line:
   ```go
   // Before:
   // Foo does something.
   //
   //counterfeiter:generate -o ../../mocks/foo.go --fake-name Foo . Foo
   type Foo interface {

   // After:
   //counterfeiter:generate -o ../../mocks/foo.go --fake-name Foo . Foo

   // Foo does something.
   type Foo interface {
   ```

3. If the directive is ABOVE but has no blank line, add a blank line between directive and GoDoc:
   ```go
   // Before:
   //counterfeiter:generate -o ../../mocks/foo.go --fake-name Foo . Foo
   // Foo does something.
   type Foo interface {

   // After:
   //counterfeiter:generate -o ../../mocks/foo.go --fake-name Foo . Foo

   // Foo does something.
   type Foo interface {
   ```

4. If already correct (directive above, blank line, then GoDoc), skip.

5. Handle special cases:
   - `pkg/review/poller.go` — `ReviewPoller` has `//nolint:revive` on its own line before `type`. Current state:
     ```go
     // ReviewPoller watches all in_review prompts...
     //
     //counterfeiter:generate -o ../../mocks/review_poller.go --fake-name ReviewPoller . ReviewPoller
     //nolint:revive // ReviewPoller is the intended name per spec requirements
     type ReviewPoller interface {
     ```
     Target state — move directive above, keep `//nolint` with the type:
     ```go
     //counterfeiter:generate -o ../../mocks/review_poller.go --fake-name ReviewPoller . ReviewPoller

     // ReviewPoller watches all in_review prompts...
     //nolint:revive // ReviewPoller is the intended name per spec requirements
     type ReviewPoller interface {
     ```
</requirements>

<constraints>
- Do NOT change any directive content — only move its position
- Do NOT change any GoDoc content — only move its position
- Do NOT change any code
- Preserve all `//nolint` annotations with the type they belong to
- Do NOT commit — dark-factory handles git
- `make precommit` must pass
- `make generate` must still produce identical mocks
</constraints>

<verification>
Run `make precommit` — must pass.

Verify correct ordering (directive before GoDoc with blank line):
```bash
# Check that no GoDoc immediately precedes a counterfeiter directive
grep -rn -B1 "counterfeiter:generate" pkg/ --include="*.go" | grep "// [A-Z]"
# Expected: no output (GoDoc should not be directly before directive)
```

Verify mocks unchanged:
```bash
make generate
git diff mocks/
# Expected: no changes
```
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All ~22 interfaces have directive ABOVE GoDoc with blank line separator
- No GoDoc content changed
- No directive content changed
- `make generate` produces identical mocks
- `make precommit` passes
</success_criteria>
